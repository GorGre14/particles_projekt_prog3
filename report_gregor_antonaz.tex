\begin{abstract}
This report presents my performance analysis of three different computational approaches I implemented for the ChargedParticles physics simulation: Sequential, Parallel (multi-threaded), and Distributed (RMI-based) processing. I tested scalability, efficiency, and practical performance across different problem sizes to see which approach works best. Key findings show that parallel mode achieved excellent speedup (2.5x-3.9x) with 70.9\% efficiency, while distributed mode showed good scalability (1.5x-1.9x speedup) though network overhead was an issue.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

The ChargedParticles simulation models charged particle behavior in 2D space using classical electrostatics. This computationally intensive application made for an ideal case study to evaluate different parallel computing approaches. The simulation implements Coulomb's law for force calculations, which results in O(n²) computational complexity - perfect for seeing how parallelization helps.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Test Configuration}
I followed the assignment requirements pretty closely for my performance evaluation:

\textbf{Test 1: Fixed Particles Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Fixed particle count: 3,000 particles
    \item Variable cycles: 500 to 10,000 (increment: 500)
    \item Purpose: See how performance scales with computational complexity
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Test 2: Fixed Cycles Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Fixed cycle count: 10,000 cycles
    \item Variable particles: 500 to 5,000 (increment: 500)
    \item Purpose: Check scalability as problem size grows
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Test Parameters:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Runs per configuration: 3 (for statistical validity)
    \item Timeout per simulation: 300 seconds
    \item Maximum runtime threshold: 180 seconds per configuration
    \item Statistical measures: Mean execution time and standard deviation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance Metrics}

\end{figure}

The analysis reveals some pretty clear patterns for each computational approach:

\caption{Fixed Particles Test Results}
\begin{tabular}{@{}cccccc@{}}
\toprule

\end{table}

\textbf{Key Observations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Parallel mode consistently beats both sequential and distributed approaches
    \item Distributed mode shows good performance for smaller problems, but I started seeing network overhead become a real issue at scale
    \item All modes demonstrate linear scaling with cycle count, which confirms O(n) complexity per cycle
\end{itemize}

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Key Observations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item You can clearly see the quadratic scaling behavior as particle count increases (O(n²) force calculations)
    \item Parallel mode maintains pretty consistent speedup across all particle counts
    \item Distributed mode performance really starts degrading with larger particle counts due to communication overhead
\end{itemize}

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Performance Analysis:}

    \item \textbf{Parallel Mode}: Achieves excellent efficiency (65-71\%) getting close to that ideal 4x speedup
    \item \textbf{Distributed Mode}: Shows moderate efficiency (37-47\%) but limited by network communication
    \item \textbf{Scalability}: Both parallel approaches demonstrate good scalability characteristics
\end{itemize}

\section{Detailed Technical Analysis}

\subsection{Parallel Processing Performance}

The parallel implementation really impressed me with its performance:

\textbf{Strengths:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Consistent 2.5x-3.9x speedup across all test configurations
    \item High efficiency (65-71\%) showing effective processor utilization
    \item Minimal overhead compared to sequential baseline
    \item Excellent scalability with both cycle count and particle count
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Technical Implementation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Uses Java's parallel streams and thread pools
    \item Effective load balancing across available cores
    \item Minimal synchronization overhead
    \item Cache-friendly memory access patterns
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Distributed Computing Analysis}

The distributed RMI-based implementation showed some interesting patterns, though honestly I was a bit disappointed by the network overhead:

\textbf{Strengths:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Good performance for smaller problem sizes
    \item Successfully demonstrates distributed computing feasibility
    \item Maintains reasonable speedup (1.5x-1.9x) despite network overhead
    \item Successfully coordinated 4 distributed worker nodes
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Limitations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Network communication overhead becomes pretty significant at scale
    \item Serialization costs for particle state distribution
    \item RMI registry coordination latency
    \item Diminishing returns with increased problem complexity
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Network Overhead Analysis:}
At first I underestimated how much network latency would affect performance. The communication costs really do scale with particle count, and worker coordination requires synchronization points that slow things down. Data serialization and deserialization overhead also adds up.

\subsection{Scalability Characteristics}

\end{figure}

\textbf{Problem Size Scaling:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sequential}: Linear increase with cycles, quadratic with particles
    \item \textbf{Parallel}: Maintains proportional scaling with excellent efficiency
    \item \textbf{Distributed}: Good scaling for moderate sizes, overhead becomes apparent at scale
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Complexity Analysis:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item All implementations correctly demonstrate O(n²) complexity for particle interactions
    \item Parallel processing effectively distributes computational load
    \item Distributed approach shows sublinear scaling due to communication costs
\end{itemize}
